// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

prompt first int "a"
prompt second int "b"
 int a+b = sum
  display int sum
end procedure

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

prompt enter int a
 int a/2
  if divisable
  then even
  other odd
end procedure

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

prompt first int "a"
prompt second int "b"
prompt third int "c"
prompt forth int "d"
prompt fifth int "e"
add a + b + c + d + e = sum
divide sum by 5 = av
create array int m[]={a, b, c, d, e}
 sort array
display - "the average of numbers entered is" av
display - "m[0]" "minimum"
display - "m[4]" "maximum"
end procedure
